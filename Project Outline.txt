Project Tracking


Milestones:

1.Build Data Model - Complete

2.Develop components to manage crud operations

3.Develop navigation

4.Make it pretty


The services folder will contain all of our crud operations.  We will need services to connect
to each database tables.

AccountService
BudgetedItemService
ClassificationService
PayeeService
TransactionService

each will have four tasks
Get____Async
Create____Async
Update____Async
Delete____Async

the component level will contain the logic to 
display everything accept inputs and manage
data validation.  That seems like alot, am I missing
something?

What is MVP?  
At minimum must be able to create and modify accounts, create and modify budget items, record account transactions,
maintain balances, display the budget view, and display the ledger view.
