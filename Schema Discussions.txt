When we query the budget items

budgeted amounts will need to be tracked for the month they are in?

If no data exists for current month previous month can be used?

One table to track changes?

Built in change tracking

Every budget item has a different entry for each month?

####
We can track an item in a single row until it changes.  We can assign a property to it "Last Active Month"
as long as that value is NULL we can continue to use it.  Once the user changes the budgeted amount the 
"Last active month" will be set to the previous month and a new entry will be created.  When querying we will 
look for all items belonging to the user with NULL for the last active month.  If a user tries to query 
against older data we will first look for entries that were last active in the matching month of the 
supplied view, and if none is found finding a matching NULL entry.
#####

#####
We will have a table to track all transactions, and a table to track all budgeted amounts.

The budget view will need to query both tables.  One query to get all the budgeted amounts for a given month,
and another query to see all transactions applied against that query in the given month.  
####
Previous months may have a balance forward.  

These can be tracked in another table??

If we track them as transactions we have to worry about updating them if someone updates retroactively.

####
We can track the balance forward in the budgeted amount table?
###

How does this work?

####
Whenever a transaction is applied against a given item the current balance can be calculated and the BudgetedItems
table updated.
####

do we need a table to store classifications.  We can just as easily put this into a budgeteditems column.

###
We still need it to make the user interface easier.  We creating new items grabbing the list of classifications will
be easier/faster
